The solver employs one of two algorithms, depending on the scale of the problem:
 - small scale -> brute force algorithm ("solver.exe")
 - larger scale -> sarsa solver (reinforcment learning?)

It seems to use no limits in the run script.

Problems:
 - could not get it to run since it has arm architecture. It is also unclear 
 how the container is supposed to work; it has run.sh but otherwise *.exe files.
 - Florian discovered that the test deciding the solver is most likely broken
 since it doesn't actually execute the command.
