Solver needs two external sources:
 - https://github.com/Pronte/ECC (edge clique cover computation)
 - https://nusmv.fbk.eu/ (bounded model checking)

The solver first transforms the .col file in several steps:
 - col2nde: ??
   -> takes .col as input, results in *.nde
 - ECC8.jar: computes edge clique cover
   -> takes *.nde as input, results in *.ecc
 - ecc2mat: ??
   -> takes *.nde-rand.EPSc.cover file as input (??), results in *.mat

It then runs two components sequentially:
 - a greedy search on the *original* input files
   - has a parameter "10000", so maybe a timeout of 10000 seconds?
   - creates a new .dat file on failure
 - a bounded model checker. 
   - first transforms the *.mat and new .dat file into a NuSVM model
   - then attempts to add LTL formulas that are based on the new .dat file
   - finally calls NuSVM with a bound of 20
