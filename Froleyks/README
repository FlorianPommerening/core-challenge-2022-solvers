Quote from the planner abstract:

```
We generated the log Ô¨Åles in parallel on 32 nodes of our cluster. Each
node has access to two 8-core Intel Xeon E5-2620 v4 CPUs running at 2.10
GHz (turbo-mode disabled) and 128 GB main memory.

Since ABC spawns multiple processes we only allocated one instance
per node. For CaMiCaL we ran 4 instances in parallel on each node. The
memory was limited to 32 GB for each of the instances. The timeout was set
to 10000 seconds for both. For the longest-track we used the same number
of instances and memory limit and a timeout of 5000 seconds.
```

- The existent track uses ABC
    - 16 cores, 128 GB, and 10000 seconds timeout per instance
- The shortest track uses CaMiCaL
    - 4 cores, 32 GB, and 10000 seconds timeout per instance
- The longest track uses CaDiCaL directly, without CaMiCaL
    - 4 cores, 32 GB, and 5000 seconds timeout per instance

I couldn't see/verify these numbers in the code.
